10. **First Boot: Disk Decryption**
    - Upon booting, you'll be prompted for your password to decrypt the hard drive. This is the secure password you set during the "Disk Partitioning" step.
    - Enter your secure password
    - Note: This decryption process takes approximately 1 minute on modern SSDs

11. **First Login**
    - The system will finish booting and log you in automatically if you selected the "Log in automatically" option during user configuration. Otherwise, you will be prompted to log in with your username and password.

## Manjikaze Installation

Once Manjaro is installed and running, you can proceed with installing the Manjikaze environment:

1. **Launch Terminal**
   - Open a terminal (you can use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+T`)

2. **Run Installation Script**
   - Ensure you are connected to the internet.
   - Execute the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/10kb/manjikaze/main/install.sh | bash
   ```

   - This will download and run the Manjikaze installation script

3. **Using Manjikaze**
   - After installation completes, start Manjikaze by typing the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   manjikaze
   ```

   - You'll be presented with the Manjikaze menu interface
   - From here, you can configure various aspects of your development environment

## Next Steps

After installation, we recommend:

1. Installing the essential development tools for your work
2. Configuring operating system preferences
3. Following the security configuration steps to set up Yubikey authentication

See the [Using Manjikaze](using-manjikaze.md) section for details about these steps.
