# Preparations

Before you begin installing Manjikaze, ensure you have the following:

## Hardware Requirements

- An x86 architecture workstation or laptop
- A Yubikey 5 for security authentication
- A USB stick with Manjaro GNOME installation media

## Account Access

- Access to your 10KB Bitwarden account
- All your passwords and secrets stored in Bitwarden

## Backup

- Complete backup of all files you want to keep that aren't already stored in a remote Git repository

## Connectivity

- A wired internet connection or your WiFi password ready

## Password

- Prepare a secure password for unlocking your computer that meets our security requirements
- Your password must be at least 12 characters long and include lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters
- The system will automatically audit your password strength during the first startup

## Important Security Notes

- After setup, you will need both your secure password AND Yubikey to unlock your computer
- There is no alternative method to access data on your computer without these
- While there is a procedure to generate a new Yubikey (requiring Bitwarden access), losing your password will make your data permanently unavailable
- This workstation is designed for a single user - if you share your computer with others, you must set up dual boot to allow others to use a separate OS

## Next Step

Everything set? Now continue with the [installation](installation.md)!
