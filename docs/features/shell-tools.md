## Modern CLI Tools

Manjikaze includes several modern replacements for traditional Unix tools to enhance your command-line experience:

### Zoxide

[Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) is a smarter alternative to the `cd` command that tracks your most used directories. After visiting a directory once, you can jump to it from anywhere by typing part of its name:

```bash
# First visit a directory normally
cd ~/Projects/manjikaze/documentation

# Later, jump to it from anywhere with just
z manjikaze
```

The more you use a directory, the higher priority it gets in zoxide's ranking.

### Bat

[Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) is a modern replacement for `cat` with syntax highlighting, line numbers, Git integration, and more:

```bash
# View a file with syntax highlighting
bat config.yaml

# Use as a colorizing pager for other commands
git show | bat
```

### Fd

[Fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) is a simple, fast, and user-friendly alternative to the `find` command:

```bash
# Find all markdown files in current directory
fd .md

# Find all files containing "config" in name
fd config
```

### Btop

[Btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop) is an advanced system monitor that shows CPU, memory, disk, and network usage in a visually appealing interface. Launch it by typing `btop` in your terminal.

### SSHS

[SSHS](https://github.com/quantumsheep/sshs) is an SSH connection manager that helps you organize and connect to your SSH servers quickly. Run `sshs` to see a list of available connections.

### SVGO

[SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo) is a tool for optimizing SVG files. Use it to reduce the size of your SVG files before deployment:

```bash
# Optimize a single SVG file
svgo icon.svg

# Optimize all SVGs in a directory
svgo -f ./icons/
```

### OpenVPN 3

[OpenVPN 3](https://codeberg.org/OpenVPN/openvpn3-linux) is an OpenVPN platform that provides a VPN client. You can manage your VPN connections using simple commands:

```bash
# Load a config file
openvpn3 config-import --config ${client.ovpn}

# Start a VPN session
openvpn3 session-start --config ${client.ovpn}
```

## AWS Tools

Manjikaze includes tools for working with AWS:

-   **AWS CLI** - Command-line interface for interacting with AWS services
-   **AWS Vault** - Tool for securely storing and accessing AWS credentials

Detailed documentation for AWS tools is available in the [AWS-specific documentation](aws-tools.md).

## Customizing Your Shell

You can customize your shell environment by editing the following files:

-   `~/.zshrc` - Main Zsh configuration file
-   `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/` - Directory for custom plugins and themes

To add new Oh My Zsh plugins, edit the plugins line in your `.zshrc` file:

```bash
plugins=(archlinux aws docker docker-compose git git-flow zoxide your-new-plugin)
```

Then reload your configuration with `source ~/.zshrc`.
