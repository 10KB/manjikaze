# Updates

Keeping your Manjikaze system up-to-date is crucial for security, stability, and access to the latest features. Manjikaze provides convenient methods to keep both itself and your installed applications updated.

## Manjikaze Self-Updates

Manjikaze automatically checks for updates each time you run the application. When an update is available, you'll be prompted to update with a simple confirmation dialog:

```
Updates available. Would you like to update Manjikaze?
```

It's recommended to approve these updates to ensure you have the latest features and security patches.

## Updating Installed Applications

Manjikaze provides a convenient menu option to update all installed applications:

1. Launch Manjikaze
2. Navigate to `Setup > Update installed apps`
3. The system will update all installed packages using both `pacman` and `yay`

## Update Frequency

It's recommended to run the update command at least every two weeks to keep your system up-to-date. Regular updates help maintain:

- System security
- Application stability
- Access to the latest features
- Compatibility with new software

For Arch-based systems like Manjaro, staying current is especially important due to the rolling release nature of the distribution.
