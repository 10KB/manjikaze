# 10kb Workstation Setup - Product Requirement Document

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
To create an automated workstation setup script that simplifies the process of configuring a fresh Linux installation for 10kb developers, ensuring consistency and reducing setup time.

### 1.2 Target Users
- Primary: Junior developers at 10kb
- Secondary: All other developers at 10kb

## 2. Core Requirements

### 2.1 System Requirements
- Base System: Manjaro Linux

- Default Shell: zsh

### 2.2 User Interface Requirements
- All user interactions must use the Gum CLI tool for consistent and user-friendly input
- Clear status messages must be displayed during installation
- Error messages must be explicit and actionable

### 2.3 Installation Process
The setup script must:
1. Be executable with minimal user intervention
2. Be idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
3. Exit immediately on any error (using `set -e`)
4. Provide clear feedback on progress
5. Allow user customization where appropriate

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Package Management
- Must use pacman for official repository packages
- Must use yay for AUR packages
- All package installations must use quiet mode flags:
  - `--noconfirm --noprogressbar --quiet`

### 3.2 User Customization
The script must offer choices for:
- Development IDE/Editor
- Terminal emulator
- Browser selection
- Git GUI client

All offered tools must be:
- Open source
- Available in official repositories or AUR
- Well-maintained and stable

### 3.3 Required Software Categories
1. Development Tools
   - Version Control (Git)
   - Build tools
   - Development environment
   - Container runtime

2. System Tools
   - Terminal emulator
   - Shell configuration
   - System monitors
   - File managers

3. Productivity Tools
   - Web browser
   - Text editor
   - PDF viewer
   - Screenshot tool

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Error Handling
The script must:
- Use `set -e` to stop on first error
- Provide clear error messages
- Include error recovery instructions where possible
- Log all errors for debugging

### 4.2 User Input Handling
Must use Gum for all user interactions:
- `gum choose` for selection menus
- `gum confirm` for yes/no questions
- `gum input` for single-line text input
- `gum write` for multi-line text input

### 4.3 Logging
- Must use the `status` function for consistent logging
- Log all major operations
- Provide clear success/failure indicators
- Include timestamps in logs

## 5. Quality Requirements

### 5.1 Performance
- Complete setup should take no longer than 30 minutes
- Package downloads should be concurrent where possible
- Progress indicators for long-running operations

### 5.2 Reliability
- Scripts must be tested on fresh Manjaro installations
- All package installations must verify successful completion
- Network failure handling must be implemented
- Backup creation before major system changes

### 5.3 Maintainability
- Clear script structure and organization
- Modular design for easy updates
- Documentation for all custom functions
- Version control for all scripts

## 6. Documentation Requirements

### 6.1 User Documentation
Must include:
- Prerequisites
- Installation instructions
- Troubleshooting guide
- List of installed software
- Post-installation steps

### 6.2 Developer Documentation
Must include:
