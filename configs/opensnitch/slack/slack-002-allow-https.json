    "description": "Allow Slack to connect to any destination on port 443 (TCP and UDP). Slack uses many dynamic AWS IP addresses for Chime (Huddles/calls) media relay, WebSocket connections, and API endpoints. These connections often lack a hostname, so domain-based rules alone are insufficient. Restricting to port 443 ensures only HTTPS, QUIC, and WebRTC traffic is allowed — no arbitrary port access.",
