# Environment
- This provisioning code is designed to run on Manjaro Linux.

# User Input
- User input should be handled using the Gum package.
- Gum documentation: https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum
- For user choices, prefer `gum choose` or `gum confirm`.
- For text input, use `gum input`.
- For multi-line input, use `gum write`.

# Script Design
- All scripts should be designed to be re-runnable without causing issues.

# Package Management
- Use `pacman` for official repository packages.
- Use `yay` for AUR packages.
- Add `--noconfirm --noprogressbar --quiet` to all `yay` and `pacman` commands.
- Add `-s` to all `curl` commands to enable silent mode.

# Error Handling
- Include proper error handling in scripts.
- Use `set -e` at the beginning of scripts to exit on any error.

# Logging
- Use the `status` function for consistent logging across scripts.
